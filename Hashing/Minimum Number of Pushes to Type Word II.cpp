// Leetcode - 3016



// Input: word = "xyzxyzxyzxyz"
// Output: 12
  
// Explanation: The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
// "x" -> one push on key 2
// "y" -> one push on key 3
// "z" -> one push on key 4
// Total cost is 1 * 4 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 4 = 12
// It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.
// Note that the key 9 is not mapped to any letter: it is not necessary to map letters to every key, but to map all the letters.
